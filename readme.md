AVL Trees
=========
This repository contains code to create and modify an AVL binary search tree, and serves as a reference implementation for my kernel's address space allocation system, which uses AVL trees for quick (de)allocation and lookup. You're free to use this however you want. I can't promise you it's bug free, but it seems to work just fine.
